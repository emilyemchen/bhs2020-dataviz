Repository for the Brainhack School 2020's Week 3 data visualization submission

ABIDE Group repository: [https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/abide-fmri](https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/abide-fmri)

June 7: My official submission is an interactive plot accessible through the Jupyter notebook. In the upcoming week, I may experiment around and try to deploy an interactive dashboard using Heroku if possible (I've started this process but there are some unresolvable bugs that need to be addressed). 

Edit (June 8): After meeting with Agah, I have redone my submission because he has shown me it is possible to create .html files for each of my plots. The plots will now show up online using GitHub pages rather than having to load the Jupyter notebook.
