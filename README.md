Repository for the Brainhack School 2020's Week 3 data visualization submission

ABIDE Group repository: [https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/abide-fmri](https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/abide-fmri)

My official submission is an interactive plot accessible through the Jupyter notebook. In the upcoming week, I may experiment around and try to deploy a dashboard using Heroku if possible (I've started this process but there are some unresolvable bugs that need to be addressed).
